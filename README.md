# SPESC

SPESC is the specification language for smart contracts proposed by Xiao.H et al. It can specify a smart contract in a form similar to real-world contracts using a natural language-like syntax, where the obligations and rights of the parties and the rules for trading cryptocurrencies are clearly defined. For now SPESC is working to the legalization of smart contracts.

## Introduction

In SPESC, a contract consists of the parties, contract properties, terms and data type definitions, which provide a clear definition of the rights and obligations of the participants and can meet the needs of most legal contract writing. At the same time, SPESC is more inclined to natural language, it can specify a smart contract in a similar form to real-world contracts using a natural-language-like grammar, which means it can be easily adopted and learned by both IT and non-IT professionals, and has great potential to facilitate the development and application of collaborative smart contracts.
