# SPESC

  SPESC是由Xiao.H等人提出的智能合约的规范语言，它可以用类似于自然语言的语法，以类似于现实世界合约的形式来指定智能合约，其中明确规定了当事人的义务和权利以及加密货币的交易规则。现在SPESC正致力于实现智能合约的法律化。

  SPESC is the specification language for smart contracts proposed by Xiao.H et al. It can specify a smart contract in a form similar to real-world contracts using a natural language-like syntax, where the obligations and rights of the parties and the rules for trading cryptocurrencies are clearly defined. For now SPESC is working to the legalization of smart contracts.

**Introduction**

  在SPESC中，合同由当事方，合同属性，条款和数据类型定义组成，它对参与方的权利和义务实现了清晰的定义，可以满足绝大多数法律合同的撰写需求。同时SPESC是一种类自然语言，它可以使用类似于自然语言的语法以类似于现实世界合约的形式指定智能合约，这意味着IT人士和非IT人士都可以轻松的接纳和学习它，对促进协作智能合约的开发与应用存在巨大潜力。
  
  In SPESC, a contract consists of the parties, contract properties, terms and data type definitions, which provide a clear definition of the rights and obligations of the participants and can meet the needs of most legal contract writing. At the same time, SPESC is more inclined to natural language, it can specify a smart contract in a similar form to real-world contracts using a natural-language-like grammar, which means it can be easily adopted and learned by both IT and non-IT professionals, and has great potential to facilitate the development and application of collaborative smart contracts.
